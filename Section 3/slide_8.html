  <h1 class="num-border">Family Emergency Scams</h1>
  <p class="slide-quote">
    This is currently the most common and hardest to spot scam. In this scam you
    will receive a call supposedly from a family memeber in jail, sometimes in a
    foreign jail, saying that they need money. <br /><br />
    The most foolproof way to prevent these scams is to
    <strong>ask personal questions</strong> such as: What color is your car?
    What is the name of your childhood pet? What is your favorite food? Be
    warned that scammers commonly use <strong>AI voice cloners</strong> to sound
    closer to someone you know, and they can
    <strong>clone cell phone numbers</strong> to appear trustworthy. If you are
    still unsure if the call is real, look up the phone number of the jail they
    are supposedly being held in and call and ask if the person is actually in
    custody.
