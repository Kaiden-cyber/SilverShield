  <p class="slide-quote">
    In a government imposter scam scammers pretend to be from a government
    agency such as the IRS or Medicare claiming that there is something wrong
    and they need money or your SSN.<br /><br />
    The best way to find these scams is to understand that a legitimate
    governemnt agency will NEVER ask for your information over the phone.
