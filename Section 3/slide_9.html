  <h1 class="num-border">Crypto Scams</h1>
  <p class="slide-quote">
    These scams are hard to identify from the start because they can start as
    any of the previously listed scams, but then the scammer will demand payment
    in cryptocurrency. This is a major red flag because cryptocurrency and gift
    cards are scammers favorite ways toget paid because they are almost
    untraceable.
