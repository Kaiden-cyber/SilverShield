    <strong>Steps to secure your account if it has been hacked:</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>1.</strong> Don't panic, if your data has appeared in a breach this
    does not mean they have logged into your account
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2.</strong> Decide if you need this account anymore, if not delete
    it. Otherwise, change the password to something much more secure
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3.</strong> Add this new password into your password manager
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>4.</strong> If you have reused this password on any other accounts
    change them immediately.
